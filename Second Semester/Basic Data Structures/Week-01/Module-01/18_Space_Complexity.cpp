    We calculate space complexity just for array,string,vector etc. Space complexity is not calculate for single variables and fixed size array,vector etc.
    Space complexity calculate rules:-
    space complexity = (input space + auxiliary space)
    Than all mathmatical calculation is 100% same like time complexity!!
